# Phantom Masternodes

Here you will find the installation scripts for a comfortable setup for the Phantom Masternode solution.

The setup is divided into the basic installation and the master node installation for each project. Everything is script based and you have the whole system functional in 10 minutes. Please install it on a newly installed Ubuntu 20.04 server.

## Donation

**Please donate for our project that we can continue to run it actively and add as many masternodes as possible.**

## A note from the developer

Phantoms have been released to make it easier, and less costly, for masternode supporters to host their own nodes. Masternode hosting companies are free to utilize the phantom system as long as they comply with the terms of the Server Side Public License.
